======================
A project to create a simple insert for EMT poles that can be used to prop up shade cloth.

The idea is that you drive a 24" length 1/2" rebar stake about 12" into the ground, you then put an 3/4" EMT pole over the rebar stake. This EMT pole props up the shade cloth stretched out above it. Unfortunately shade cloth has lots of holes in it so your EMT will snag and rip your shade under stress. Others have in the past used tennis balls with holes cut into them which are then gaffer taped to the top of the EMT. This is pretty messy, and prone to failure or general stickiness.

This 3d printed insert should fit snuggly into your EMT tubing, and then provides a nice smooth rounded support to ensure your shade doesn't get caught or damaged.

NOTE: UNTESTED
==============
As yet this has not been printed, or tested in EMT tubing. Will update with photos once we know it works!
